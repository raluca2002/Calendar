This Java code defines a class MeetingFinder with a static method findAvailableMeetingTimes that takes in two calendars,
their range limits, and a required meeting time, and returns a list of all available time slots for a meeting that can be
scheduled between the two calendars.
The findAvailableMeetingTimes method first calculates the common range of time that both calendars are available (the
intersection of their range limits), represented by rangeStart and rangeEnd. It then merges the two calendars into a
single sorted list of events using the mergeCalendars helper method. The mergeCalendars method takes two calendar lists,
concatenates them into a single list, and sorts them based on their start times.
The findAvailableMeetingTimes method then iterates through the sorted event list and computes the available time between
each pair of adjacent events. If the time between two events is greater than or equal to the required meeting time, it
adds the available time to the availableTimes list. The method also computes the available time between the last event
and the end of the common range of time, and adds that to the availableTimes list if it is greater than or equal to the
required meeting time.
The remaining methods getMinutes and getTimeString are helper methods to convert time strings to minutes and vice versa.
Finally, the main method sets up two example calendars, range limits, and meeting time, calls the findAvailableMeetingTimes
method, and prints out the resulting list of available meeting times.
